NOTE: This engine uses MyBB as database for players. You need to set up a MyBB forum first. Players need to log in on forum and then they can access the game.

After installing MyBB you need to upload source files in desirable directory and edit two files: index.php (using favorite text editor) and 4.swf (JPEXS).
